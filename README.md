CNN and MNIST using Go

### Computer Vision (MNSIT images) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)  
This repo sets up some Go code to read in MNIST images leveraging the [GoMNIST](https://github.com/petar/GoMNIST) repo. It loads in all the images and displays some examples in grayscale. See example image below:
